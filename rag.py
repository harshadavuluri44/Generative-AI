RAG combines an LLM with an external knowledge source (like documents, database, PDFs).


RAG is a technique where relevant external data is retrieved at query time based on user question and provided to LLM to generate a
response


Before generating an answer, it retrieves relevant information and feeds it to the LLM, making responses more accurate, up-to-date,
and grounded.



In Short:

    LLM = Brain (language understanding & generation)
    RAG = Brain + Open-book (retrieves real data before answering)
