Classic vs Pro SQL warehouses is not about size (X-small, Large, 2X-Large, etc.)

Instead, Classic and Pro are tiers of SQL warehouses that differ in features and workload management.


classic - limited concurrency and basic queuing

Pro - more expensive, but adds advanced workload management so multiple users and mixed workloads run smoothly without manual tuning.
