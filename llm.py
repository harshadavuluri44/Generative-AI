An LLM is a deep learning model trained on massive amounts of text to understand, generate, and reason
with human language.


It can answer questions, summarize text, write code, and more based on patterns learned during training
(e.g., GPT, LLaMA)


LIMITATION :- Knowledge is fixed to training data and it may hallucinate or give outdated answers.
